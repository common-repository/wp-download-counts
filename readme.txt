== Description ==

So youâ€™ve written some WordPress plugins and now you want to let your readers know about them?

The WP Download Counts plugin lets you do just that. It adds a sidebar widget which retrieves a list of your plugins and displays them along with the current download count (updated every 15 mins) and a link to each plugin's listing in the WordPress Plugin Directory.

Features include:

* Minimal configuration required - just a title and your WordPress username 
* Plugins listed in order of the most-downloaded first.
* Plugin information cached for 15 minutes to minimize overhead

== Installation ==

The plugin is simple to install and setup.

To install it, do the following:

1. In your WordPress Dashboard go to "Plugins > Add New"
2. Search for "WP Download Counts"
3. Click "Install Now"
4. Click "Activate Plugin"

That's it, the wordpress plugin download counter should now be installed on your blog.

Now to setup the plugin:

1. In your WordPress Dashboard go to "Appearance > Widgets"
2. Drag the "WP Download Counts" widget to your sidebar
3. Click on "WP Download Counts" to view the widget settings

5. Add your WordPress.org username
6. Click "Save"

There's nothing else to do. If you visit your site you should now see a listing of your published WordPress plugins.
